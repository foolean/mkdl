Diskless Utility
================

mkdl (Make Diskless Linux) is a simple script to create a diskless
Linux image that can boot from PXE, or any other bootable source,
without the need for NFS.  

CentOS:

Debian:
    This work is based on David LaRose's document:
        How To Set Up a Diskless Debian GNU/Linux Box
        http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dlr/debian_netboot_v1.2.pdf


Usage
=====

    usage: mkdl.centos [OPTIONS]

    Where:
        -a [ARCH]     - Architecture to build an image for
        -c            - Chroot into the image after building it
                        (useful for last-minute changes before packing)
        -d            - Print additional debugging messages
        -h            - Print this message and exit
        -i [FILE]     - File with the list of additional packages to add
        -o [OS]       - Operating system to build an image for
        -O [PATH]     - Path to place the output files in
        -p [PASSWD]   - Password to use for the root account in the image
        -r [RELEASE]  - Operating system release to build
        -v            - Print more verbose output

    Examples:
    
    # Create a Debian Wheezy image
    $PATH_TO/mkdl -d -r wheezy

    The resulting image, kernel, and PXE configuration sample will be
    found in: $DUTIL_ROOT/pxe/debian/$CODENAME/$ARCH/


Output structure
================

* Output root defaults to ~/mkdlbuild

$OUTPUT_ROOT
+---+ pxe
|     +---+ $OS
|           +---+ $RELEASE
|                 +---+ $ARCHITECTURE
|
+---+ rootfs
      +---+ $OS
            +---+ $RELEASE
                  +---+ $ARCHITECTURE

example:
  /tmp/diskless/rootfs/centos/6/x86_64/
  /tmp/diskless/rootfs/debian/wheezy/x86_64/
  etc.


Operating Systems
=================

    mkdl currently only supports the CentOS and Debian operating system though
    it will be extended to more operating systems in the future.


Dependencies
============

    Debian:
        debootstrap - the main utility used to build the inital image
        lsb-release - the lsb-release utility is used to get the current 
                      operating system codename.
        whois       - the mkpasswd command is part of the whois package
